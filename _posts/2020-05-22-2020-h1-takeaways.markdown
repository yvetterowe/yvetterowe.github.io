As I described in [an earlier post](https://haoluo.io/posts/beyond-the-first-few-years), I didn't feel comfortable at all when starting my second job. It has been six months since then (crazy six months for this planet, I know), I can't say I'm back to my comfort zone now but there are definitely some takeaways that worth noting.

#### Async communication
Async communication will just get more and more important as more employers embrace remote work. But even without that, I find this format of communication helpful in general - it forces people to structuralize their thoughts, exactly the feature of writing. When I first started, I got super frustrated with the high communication cost when I got stuck at my daily work. Why can't I just direct message someone like "Yo I don't know how to do X, tell me plz"? Why do I have to "waste" my time drafting a post in a support group to get help? But as I get more comfortable doing this, it turns out to bring out some side effects that I didn't expect before, in a good way. 

I bet we all encounter some moments when people jump into your Slack channel for Q&A. An ideal scenario would be like this: 

> Alice: Yo I don't know how to do X, please help. <br>
> Bob: First you need to do A, then B, and finally C. Done. <br>
> Alice: Thanks! <br>
> Bob: You're welcome!

But more often things turn out like this:

> Alice: Yo I don't know how to do X, please help. <br>
> Bob:  Did you do A by any chance? <br>
> Alice: Yep A works. <br>
> Bob: What's the result of A? <br>
> Alice: Here it is. <br>
> Bob: This looks good. Did you do B then? <br>
> Alice: Nope. <br>
> Bob: Could you try that? <br>
> Alice: Sure give me a seconds… yeah B works too. <br>
> Bob: Weird. Could you remind me why you need X? <br>
> Alice: I was trying to do Y but got stuck getting X work. <br>
> Bob: I see. I don't think X is the best way to achieve Y, you should do Z. <br>

Alice is the one who needs help, but it takes a couple more prompts to collect information from her. I would be a bit frustrated if I was Bob. So how can Alice do better?

> Alice: My goal is Y but I got stuck at X. I did A and here's the results. Please advise the next step, thanks! <br>
> Bob:  I don't think X is the best way to achieve Y, you should do Z. <br>

Or it could be:

> Bob:  Yeah X is the right way for Y. From your results of A, seems you're missing B. Could you try B?

There are two perspectives why this helps. First, a question with context, goal and the path to get stuck simply *help other people to help you*. This pre-processing of information eliminates the overhead for others to go over the problem from scratch and more importantly avoid deriving solutions based on *interpretations*/*assumptions* instead of *facts*. Second, I find writing the thought process down helps me fill in the gaps of my mind flow when reasoning about a problem (remember those proofs in highschool maths? xD). A classic mutter could be like:

> Ok my goal is Y and I got stuck at X. I've done A and B, and they work as expected. Hmm so why X doesn't work? But wait…B isn't necessarily related to X right? There're some pieces missing here…Holy f, C actually connects B and X but I didn't consider it at all!

Yeah we think we really understand the problem until we write it down. To others who help us by consuming our information, it's a pre-processing; To ourselves, it's more like a post-processing that enhances the outputs.

#### Incremental correctness 

> Perfectionism is often an excuse for procrastination.

True. I've always been struggled with the frustration of not being 100% correct when learning something new. *Get overwhelmed → get stuck → lose momentum completely* is a classic script to achieve "From Beginning to Nothing". Later, I figure out a more sustainable process for me is just being *OK* with not getting stuff completely correct at the very beginning. As we continue with the process of learning by doing, in a large chance the problem that bothers us will surface again - and by which time we usually either curate a global view and a deeper understanding of the whole problem space, which helps solve that particular problem; Or we simply find that particular problem just makes more sense in a concrete context. Then it's the perfect time for a deep dive and correction. Keep the momentum and iteration.
