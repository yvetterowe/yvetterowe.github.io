2020 is...weird. When saying "2019 is a year of moving and decision making", I didn't expect 2020 to be completely opposite - a year of being stuck at home. The quarantine time did give me a chance to explore the world and myself in a more reflective way rather than the experiential way, which is sometimes inspiring while other times painful. A couple takeaways: 

#### On Well-Being
* Eat well, sleep well, workout regularly and always have something to look forward to. 
* It's OK to have strong and bad emotions, but we're not defined by our emotions. 

#### On Personal Development
* Make it easy to take risks.
* Be aware of thinking traps.

#### On Creative Work
* Don't mix objectives. Stick to the one you care about most and try not to get upset about failing to meet others.
* Motion != progress.
* Balance self-belief with self-awareness. Manage morale, and seek truth.
