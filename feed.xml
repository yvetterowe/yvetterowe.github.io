My first try was with Headspace‚Äîback then it was one of the most popular apps. But as someone who‚Äôs very sensitive to voice, I wasn‚Äôt sold at all. The guide‚Äôs voice felt so AI (sorry!), like a machine babbling away, not a real, flesh-and-blood person. I quickly gave up, thinking: <em>what‚Äôs the point of just sitting here</em>?</p>

<p>Later, when life and work started to weigh on me, I came back to it. This time I switched to Peloton. Their meditations were led by influencer instructors with personality and warmth, not a cold, generic voice. I especially loved Anna Greenberg‚Äîshe has this gentle yet powerful presence, and every yoga or meditation class with her left me both grounded and relaxed. The only catch was that her classes only dropped once every week or two, and I soon ran through them all. At that point I wasn‚Äôt comfortable meditating unguided yet, so my practice stayed inconsistent.</p>

<p>The real turning point came this year. Maybe it was the slow creep of a millennial midlife crisis, but I felt drawn to change, driven to pursue the dreams I‚Äôd kept on hold, and to see the blind spots I‚Äôd been missing‚Äîto gain a wider perspective. Every meditation or yoga guide begins with: <em>set your intention</em>. And for me, my intention had finally grown clearer.</p>

<p>Following that calling, I signed up for online meditation classes at <a href="https://www.threejewels.org/">Three Jewels</a>, a nonprofit in New York. Each weekday night before bed, I joined a 30-minute Zoom class‚Äîten minutes of Dharma talk and twenty minutes of guided meditation. Practicing with a teacher and others in real time made meditation feel less isolated, more like a community.</p>

<p>Gradually, I also began sitting by myself every morning for thirty minutes. Six months in, I suddenly noticed something had shifted. I even half-joked to myself: <em>wait, did I just get enlightened</em>?</p>

<p>Before, meditation felt fleeting. During the practice I could slow my breath, find focus, and touch calm‚Äîbut it all slipped away once I stood up. Now it feels really different. It‚Äôs more like planting a seed or strength training: once the seed is planted, it keeps growing; once the muscle is built, it keeps burning calories even at rest.</p>

<p>So what muscle grew? It‚Äôs the one mentioned in almost every resource on meditation: <a href="https://www.calm.com/blog/respond-vs-react"><em>respond, not react</em></a>‚Äîthe self-awareness, the ability to create a gap between impulse and action. In my experience, that gap is still very small‚Äîmaybe one inch, or maybe five seconds if you really want to measure it‚Äîbut even within that tiny space, I start to see so many more choices‚Äîand then I can choose more consciously, in ways that align with my deeper, long-term values. I believe that for different people, this small gap may serve a different purpose‚Äîbut for each of us, it opens the doorway to where we truly wish to arrive.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs even more ‚Äúaha!‚Äù is: creating that gap itself just feels profoundly empowering. Do you remember the first time you learned how to swim or ride a bike? Or the moment you crossed a marathon finish line, or summited a mountain peak? It‚Äôs that same rush‚Äîa strong sense of self-agency. Only this time, it‚Äôs not in the body, but in the mind.</p>

<p>A small tip that helps me sustain my meditation practice is this mindset: be curious, be patient, let go of expectations, enjoy the journey‚Äîand enjoy it simply for the sake of it. I think this is the recipe for anything I‚Äôve stayed passionate about without too much willpower over the long run. I picked up running and kept at it for years‚Äînot because I had a specific weight-loss goal or a race time to hit, but because running makes me feel free and alive. I love making videos for the same reason. Meditation is no different. I cherish that half hour of being unplugged, peaceful, and grounded‚Äîa small sanctuary of time that belongs only to me. There‚Äôs a saying: ‚Äú<em>Let how you want to feel guide you</em>.‚Äù That has always worked for me.</p>

<p>No grand plan, just an open heart: what may come next around the corner?</p>]]></content><author><name>Hao Luo</name><email>yvetterowe1116@gmail.com</email></author><category term="post" /><category term="fitness" /><category term="meditation" /><category term="livingwell" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An "aha!" moment on my meditation journey.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2023 NYC Half Marathon Race Report</title><link href="https://haoluo.io/posts/nychalf2023" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2023 NYC Half Marathon Race Report" /><published>2023-04-29T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-23T15:49:25-04:00</updated><id>https://haoluo.io/posts/nychalf2023</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://haoluo.io/posts/nychalf2023"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_FDD382CF8714D7E688DD2EBA62BF9A5C63F8D9A71EA2DFA3235DB8D29F0E90E9_1682808438584_DSC02969_Original.jpg" alt="" />

<h2 id="training">Training</h2>

<p>I didn‚Äôt follow a training plan for this half marathon since I‚Äôve always known training for more than one race per year tends to burn me out and deprive that pure joy of running, which is the last thing I wanna end up with. Also, I want to keep my schedule as flexible as possible to accommodate other activities I enjoy like biking and hiking during the goal race off-season. #YOLO</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a rough breakdown of my fitness stages between the goal race last year (NYC Marathon in November) and the NYC Half:</p>
<h4 id="stage-1-cycling-focused-week-of-1121--week-of-0109-8-weeks"><strong>Stage 1. Cycling focused: week of 11/21 ~ week of 01/09 (8 weeks)</strong></h4>

<p>During this time I was following a <a href="https://us.zwift.com/">Zwift</a> cycling training plan called <a href="https://whatsonzwift.com/workouts/build-me-up">Build Me Up</a>, which consists of 3~4 1~2hr interval workouts per week. They were BRUTAL but (type 2) FUN, in a way that I‚Äôd never experienced from running intervals somehow. It felt like in running I could never push my heart rate and perceived effort to that level without risking injury. Also pedaling hard in the <a href="https://trigearlab.com/pain-cave/#:~:text=A%20pain%20cave%20is%20a,looking%20at%20a%20blank%20wall.">Pain-Cave‚Ñ¢Ô∏è</a> following the rhythm of my CURATED-WITH-LOVE-CAN-REPLAY-HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER playlist while watching pro racing clips or my fav music lives just felt incredibly in-the-zone üíÉüèª.</p>

<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_FDD382CF8714D7E688DD2EBA62BF9A5C63F8D9A71EA2DFA3235DB8D29F0E90E9_1683507312186_IMG_0513.JPG" alt="" />
<em>Lives fueled Pain-Cave‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is the best</em></p>

<p>At the same time, I maintained my regular fitness routine that incorporated 1 easy run, 1 <a href="https://solidcore.co">solidcore</a>, and 1 yoga per week. Though my weekly mileage during these two winter months was only around 10 miles, my easy run pace (~150bpm heart rate) had been shaken off 1 minute from 10/mi to 9/mi - my general aerobic fitness and lower body strength definitely benefit a lot from those WTF-IS-GOING-ON or HOW-THE-HELL-DID-I-GET-THROUGH-IT cycling intervals. KUDOOOOOO!</p>

<h4 id="stage-2-days-off-for-procedure-week-of-0117--week-of-0130-3-weeks"><strong>Stage 2. Days off for procedure: week of 01/17 ~ week of 01/30 (3 weeks)</strong></h4>

<p>Following the doctor‚Äôs order, I took three weeks off completely for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HH7hspf5Jc">my egg-freezing process</a>. During this time I walked 30~60 minutes daily to keep me moving.</p>

<p>Well, actually it‚Äôs more about keeping me SANE ü§™.</p>

<h4 id="stage-3-back-to-fitness-week-of-0206--week-of-0213-2-weeks"><strong>Stage 3. Back to fitness: week of 02/06 ~ week of 02/13 (2 weeks)</strong></h4>

<p>I didn‚Äôt feel any pain, bloating, cramping or fatigue after the egg retrieval procedure and the next few days, so I thought that was a green light that signals I was fully recovered and could just go straight bringing back the intensity. Especially with last year‚Äôs experience of running the NYC Half right after recovering from COVID and running the NYC Marathon right after recovering from <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4964-trochanteric-bursitis">trochanteric bursitis</a>, I thought I‚Äôd mastered the art of listening to my body and was pretty confident that I could get back the lost fitness safely yet quickly. But still, I underestimated what the whole process of egg freezing had done to my body - I mean yeah it was not as troublesome as I thought, but at the end of the day it was still a medical procedure, with two weeks of daily hormone hacks ü´†.</p>

<p>The steep regression of my fitness was all over the place: my easy run pace was 30 seconds slower; I struggled to hold the target power in those <a href="https://www.trainerroad.com/blog/sweet-spot-training-everything-you-need-to-know/">sweetspot intervals</a>; The <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/621940">9W state line climb</a> I used to enjoy just felt crappy; And my legs felt like tofu when cramponing up <a href="https://www.newhampshireclimbing.com/lion-head-winter-route-overview/">Mt. Washington winter trail</a>. Next time‚Ä¶next time‚Ä¶I would definitely be more gentle to my body even if I feel good - ease back with only easy runs and z2 rides. Skip the 4hr ride and the mountaineering summit attempt please ü´†.</p>

<h4 id="stage-4-get-ready-for-nyc-half-week-of-0220--week-of-0313-4-weeks"><strong>Stage 4. Get ready for NYC Half: week of 02/20 ~ week of 03/13 (4 weeks)</strong></h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>To finish first, first you must finish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a saying in bicycle racing, which also applies to ‚Äúme getting ready for NYC Half‚Äù:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First you must finish</strong>: Gradually build up the total and long run mileage - so that I can cross the finish line safely without taking another toll on my body.</li>
  <li><strong>Finish fast (sorta)</strong>: Set up a reasonable goal pace/time based on my current fitness - so that I can cross the finish line feeling good without big regrets.</li>
</ul>

<p>My weekly mileage consisted of 3 runs: 1 easy, 1 tempo, and 1 medium long (8~11mi). And I still kept cross-training like yoga, solidcore, and a weekend 4hr endurance ride. During this time, my easy pace was still around 9:30/mi and my tempo pace started settling in 8:05~8:15/mi - the lower bound was pretty much my half PB (8:17/mi, 1:48), and the upper bound can lead to a (8/mi, sub 1:45) attempt, with a little help from the racing adrenaline rush üòà - and that was where my A and B goals come from.</p>

<h2 id="pre-race">Pre-race</h2>

<h4 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The day before: Baguette sandwich for lunch; Pasta + pizza for dinner</li>
  <li>Race morning: oatmeal with maple syrup 2hr before the race; 1 gel 15min before the race.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sleep">Sleep</h4>

<p>Went to bed around 10:30. Fell asleep around 11~11:30 and woke up at 5:30. Had a pretty high-quality 6hr sleep (though my regular sleep time is 8hr).</p>

<h4 id="weathergears">Weather/Gears</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Weather: Clear, 30 F. Feels like 20 F. Humidity 43%. Wind 12.8 mi/h from WNW.</li>
  <li>Pre-race: An old cycling fleece winter jersey + NYC Marathon fleece poncho. They turned out to keep my body warm before the race effectively.</li>
  <li>Race: Merino wool long-sleeve top + long legging</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="race">Race</h2>

<p>For some reason running in New York has always felt like a film scene, full of temperature and emotions. It was a classic early Fake-NYC-Spring‚Ñ¢Ô∏è morning, a bit chilly, a bit windy, yet you could still feel the twilight and the warmth from the rising sun. I still had the same song replaying in my AirPods. Then suddenly, the starting gun fired and the crowd erupted in cheers.</p>

<p>It was a strange yet consonant feeling. The song playing in my AirPods cut me off from the rest of the world - I enjoy running alone; I‚Äôm comfortable being alone; I <em>THRIVE</em> in my own space, soaking up my own joy and pain. But at the same time I also found myself being part of this swarm - something greater than myself; something scattered yet somehow <em>connected</em>, and <em>clicked</em>.</p>

<p>One step after another, one mile at a time, I weaved through Prospect Park, turned onto Flatbush, climbed up Manhattan Bridge over East River, til the course started to flatten out in FDR with the cheers from Chinatown echoing in my ear.</p>

<p>Then I found myself winding through those midtown streets around Time Square. I saw the city recede in the distance, everything was strangely slow-motion and blurred, yet everything was immensely absorbing. It was at this point that I remembered why I adore running. ALL THIS.</p>

<p>üí≠ I might love it a little less if I loved freedom a little less.</p>

<p>üí≠ I might love it a little less if I loved solitude a little less.</p>

<p>üí≠ I might love it a little less if I loved replaying a single song for hours and hours and hours a little less.</p>

<p>üí≠ I might love it a little less if I loved that fearless yet vulnerable teenager embedded in my body a little less.</p>

<p>üí≠ I might love it a little less if I loved the YOLO urge to bring the best out of myself against all odds a little less.</p>

<p>üóØÔ∏è WOW. NO SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE.</p>

<p>The last series of climbs started at 42nd Street - this was where I could feel most people around me starting to slow down. But unlike struggling to push through the last few miles in the NYC Marathon last year, this time I felt really strong and couldn‚Äôt help but picked up the pace. Faster and faster, my legs turned over. I felt something was expanding and bursting outward, and contracting and forming inward - it was the rhythm of being - of breathing, of heartbeat, of day and night - and the rhythm of my body set off an echo in my mind. When entering the Central Park I was most familiar with, I started sprinting to empty the tank.</p>

<p>Passing people toward the end just felt SO DAMN GOOD. I loooooooove negative splits.</p>

<p>Though I didn‚Äôt end up hitting the sub 1:45 A goal, I was really happy crushing a PB while feeling so relaxed and strong toward the end. If there‚Äôs anything in race execution that could be improved for the A goal, I think it would be to warm up 0.5~1 mi before the race and pick up the pace a little bit at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="post-race">Post-race</h2>

<p>Protein shake! Photos with Momo as an NYC Half tradition! Annnnnd pizza + beef noodle soup!</p>

<h2 id="fun-facts">Fun facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The song I replayed for 1 hr 45 minutes from the beginning to the end is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhQuNYl-9SM">Ê®°Ê†∑</a> by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7m3hJRouj4fFil1ksJDx0I?autoplay=true">Deserts Chang (Âº†ÊÇ¨)</a> . It doesn‚Äôt even have a fast tempo, but it 10/10 fit my mood and the surroundings at the time. That chilly NYC spring morning.</li>
  <li>Funny I ran into someone I didn‚Äôt know before two days in a row - at a coffee shop near my home the day before the race, and on the subway car packed with runners the morning of the race. BIG CITY, small world.</li>

<ul>
  <li>A way to give from heart</li>
  <li>Hear our own deeper <em>needs</em> and those of others</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùComponents of NVC (applied to both <em>expressing honestly</em> + <em>receiving empathically</em>)</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Observation</li>
  <li>Feelings</li>
  <li>Needs</li>
  <li>Requests</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>üìùCommunication that blocks compassion</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Moralistic judgements
    <ul>
      <li>Imply wrongness or badness on people who don‚Äôt share our values</li>
      <li>Such judgements are actually expressions of our own needs and values</li>
      <li>Value judgment vs. moralistic judgement
        <ul>
          <li>value judgment: beliefs of how life can best be served</li>
          <li>moralistic judgement: they‚Äôre made when people fail to support our value judgements</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Making comparison</li>
  <li>Denial of responsibility
    <ul>
      <li>Our language obscures awareness of personal responsibility</li>
      <li>Instead of implying lack of choice, acknowledge choice</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communicate desire as demand
    <ul>
      <li>Demand threatens listeners with blame or punishments if they fail to comply</li>
      <li>People change not to avoid punishment but to benefit themselves</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>üìùObserving without evaluating</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>When combining observation with evaluation, people are apt to hear criticism.</li>
  <li>NVC discourages static generalizations; Instead, evaluations are made based on observations specific to <em>time</em> and <em>context</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùIdentifying and expressing feelings</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If we‚Äôre not <em>aware of</em> feelings, we can‚Äôt express them</li>
  <li>Feelings vs. Non-Feelings
    <ul>
      <li>Feelings != Thoughts</li>
      <li>Feelings != What we think we are (eg. ‚ÄúI feel inadequate as a guitar player‚Äù)</li>
      <li>Feelings != How we think others react or behave towards us (eg. ‚ÄúI feel understood‚Äù)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùTaking responsibility for our feelings</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What others do may be the <em>stimulus</em> of our feelings, but not the <em>cause</em></li>
  <li>4 options for receiving negative messages
    <ol>
      <li>blame ourselves</li>
      <li>blame others</li>
      <li>sense our own feelings and needs</li>
      <li>sense others‚Äô feelings and needs</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Connect feeling with need: ‚ÄúI feel‚Ä¶because I need‚Ä¶‚Äù</li>
  <li>Judgments of others are actually alienated expressions of our own <em>unmet needs</em>. If we express our needs, we have a better chance of getting them met.</li>
  <li>3 Stages
    <ol>
      <li>Emotional slavery: believe ourselves are responsible for the feelings of others (eg. feel overwhelmed when seeing partner in pain)</li>
      <li>Obnoxious: refuse to admit to caring others‚Äô feels or needs (eg. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your problem! I‚Äôm not responsible for your feelings!‚Äù)</li>
      <li>Emotional liberation: accept responsibility for our own feelings but not the feelings of others, while being aware that we can never meet our own needs at the expense of others.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùRequesting that which would enrich life</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Make request with <em>positive</em> and <em>concrete</em> actions that reveals what we want</li>
  <li>Make request <em>consciously</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Make request != express feelings</li>
      <li>We are often not conscious of what we are requesting (eg. complained loudly ‚ÄùI‚Äôve never seen a train go so slow in all my life!‚Äù)</li>
      <li>Request may sound like demand when unaccompanied with by speaker‚Äôs feelings and needs (eg. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go and get a haircut?‚Äù)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùConnecting compassionately with ourselves</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid shoulding yourself!</li>
  <li>Self-judgements, like all judgements, are tragic expressions of unmet needs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùExpressing anger fully</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hurting people when we are angry is superficial - we want a more powerful way to fully express ourselves</li>
  <li>Steps to express anger
    <ol>
      <li>Stop. Breath.</li>
      <li>Identify our judgmental thoughts</li>
      <li>Connect with our needs</li>
      <li>Express our feelings and unmet needs</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùConflict resolution and mediation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Resolve conflicts by building human connections</li>
  <li>We are taught by society to criticize, insult, and otherwise communications to that keep us apart. In a conflict, both parties usually spend too much time intent on proving themselves right and the other party wrong, rather than paying attention to their own and others‚Äô needs.</li>
  <li>Steps
    <ol>
      <li>Express our own needs</li>
      <li>Search for real needs of the other person</li>
      <li>Verify we both accurately recognize the other person‚Äôs needs</li>
      <li>Provide empathy to hear each other‚Äôs needs accurately</li>
      <li>Propose strategies for resolving the conflict, framing them in <em>positive action language</em></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùLiberating ourselves and counseling others</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on <em>what we want</em> rather than <em>what went wrong</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìùExpressing appreciation in NVC</strong></p>
<ul>

When saying ‚Äú2019 is a year of moving and decision making‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt expect 2020 to be completely opposite - a year of being stuck at home. The quarantine time did give me a chance to explore the world and myself in a more reflective way rather than the experiential way, which is sometimes inspiring while other times painful. A couple takeaways:</p>

How are you doing in the past week?</p>

<p>Me: Morning, thanks! I‚Äôm doing ok. Keep picking up more activities. I do Yoga every day. I also resume cooking, eating more veggies. Not craving carb and sweet that much anymore. Oh and I finally watched a documentary! Thank goodness. I still don‚Äôt understand why I just completely lost interest in reading and watching ‚Äúnormal movies‚Äù previously. All I wanna do every day is watching those TV series, episode after episode.</p>

<p>Lora: I know! That brainless stuff right? We do this all the time.</p>

<p>Me: Yeah exactly. Oh and‚Ä¶I booked a trip to Hawaii.</p>

<p>Lora: Wow good for you, that‚Äôs a lot of information. What caused you to resume these activities? What changed?</p>

<p>Me: I guess it starts with Yoga? I just feel both my mind and body feel better after Yoga - then I have the mood to eat healthier. Then it just kinda creates a positive feedback loop.</p>

<p>Lora: That sounds really good. Ok, tell me about the documentary. How is it?</p>

<p>Me: It‚Äôs sooooo good. It‚Äôs called My Octopus Teacher. It‚Äôs about a filmmaker - he got burnout from his work and just lost motivation for anything in life. So he took a gap year on an island, going scuba diving every day for one year - and that‚Äôs how long an octopus can live. During that short period of time, he observed the whole life of that octopus and kinda built a connection with her. It‚Äôs amazing. I never know that an octopus is really like a human being - she‚Äôs so vulnerable but she can also be so strong. And she‚Äôs so smart. She learns how to deal with difficult situations every day and how to recover from them, just like us. And you can actually see how she gradually builds that trust and relationship day by day with the filmmaker. That‚Äôs just so touching and relatable.</p>

<p>Lora: Yeah nature is always an amazing teacher. I need to mark that movie down. So that motivates you to Hawaii?</p>

<p>Me: Oh no, haha totally unrelated. I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a long time. A friend happened to mention the idea to me the other day. So we‚Äôre kinda like ‚Äúok, we need to do this‚Äù.</p>

<p>Lora: It‚Äôs great! You really need an unplug during the pandemic. What‚Äôs the last time you did the unplug thing?</p>

<p>Me: Right before the lockdown. I went to Kilimanjaro with a friend for a week. It‚Äôs wonderful. It feels so good to just be around with mountains, completely cut off from social media.</p>

<p>Lora: How do you feel when you get back from the trip?</p>

<p>Me: Re-energized. And the byproduct is before the trip I‚Äôm actually not that familiar with the girl. But during the trip, we went through so many things together and we keep in touch when getting back. It‚Äôs great that you get to know more about another person and kinda develop a connection from there. You know they‚Äôre rare to a passive and introverted person.</p>

<p>Lora: Totally. Seems you really like traveling. Is it because you find it helpful knowing more people and building friendships?</p>

<p>Me: I actually never think that much. I guess I like traveling mostly just for fun?</p>

<p>Lora: Haha that‚Äôs totally fair.</p>

<p>Me: But to be honest I‚Äôm starting to think if traveling is more of an ‚Äúescape from real life‚Äù to me.</p>

<p>Lora: That‚Äôs interesting. I could see many people take it as a ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù. How do you define ‚Äúescape‚Äù?</p>

<p>Me: I‚Äôve never realized that until the pandemic because it kinda forces you to just stay at home and face your problems. When you travel, you‚Äôre having fun and more focused on the outside world, the new experience. But when you‚Äôre stuck at a place for a long time, you just can‚Äôt help thinking about those things that you don‚Äôt really want to think about. You have nowhere to hide. You know what I mean?</p>

<p>Lora: Yeah I think I understand.</p>

<p>Me: Yeah then those thinkings just make me feel upset. Like what‚Äôs the purpose of my life? I mean I‚Äôm doing ok with my work. It feeds me well. But am I gonna do this for my whole life? I just can‚Äôt imagine it but I don‚Äôt know what else can I do.I can‚Äôt agree more with the saying that ‚Äúhappiness itself is never the goal, it‚Äôs a byproduct of being useful‚Äù.</p>

<p>Lora: Yeah you mentioned that to me before. Finding meaningfulness from work is definitely a topic we‚Äôll discuss.</p>

<p>Me: And then I kinda just take a step back, start thinking ‚Äúok, maybe finding the purpose of life just doesn‚Äôt apply to most people in the world except those like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerburg.‚Äù Probably most people are just being happily OK with having a not-that-fulfilling life? They even won‚Äôt bother to think about these things because they have kids to feed, life to maintain - more than enough to occupy their mind. Oh man, on that note I do feel I‚Äôm less bothered with these abstract stuff when I was in a stable relationship. Is that the meaning of marriage or a stable relationship? Keep you from being trapped in these random thoughts?</p>

<p>Lora: Haha wow are we going to discuss existentialism and intimate relationships? That‚Äôs a much larger scope.</p>]]></content><author><name>Hao Luo</name><email>yvetterowe1116@gmail.com</email></author><category term="post" /><category term="livingwell" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lora: Morning!

Same with SwiftUI, we also want to be mindful of view update performance.</p>

<p>SwiftUI has multiple ways to achieve the reactive-style data-driven UI update, eg. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">State</code> for local state and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ObservedObject</code> for external data source. For example, suppose there‚Äôs an  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> that renders the number of avocado in the inventory, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoStore</code> and an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> could be defined like this:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">AvocadoStore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">ObservableObject</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">@ObservedObject</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">avocadoStore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">AvocadoStore</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">body</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">some</span> <span class="kt">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Refreshing ü•ë view"</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It‚Äôs summertime, let‚Äôs get some peaches üçë as well. In practice, they probably live together with avocados in the same store.</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">FruitStore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">ObservableObject</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">AvocadoView</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">@ObservedObject</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">fruitStore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">FruitStore</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">body</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">some</span> <span class="kt">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Refreshing ü•ë view"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">repeating</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"ü•ë"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">count</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">fruitStore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">avocadoCount</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then here comes an interesting problem with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ObservableObject</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Published</code> property wrapper. Suppose someone steals the peaches, which causes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FruitStore</code> to publish a new value of  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peachCount</code>. Should  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> be affected in this case? Ideally not. But in reality, I found that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> is indeed re-constructed (‚ÄúRefreshing ü•ë view‚Äù is logged). This is because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> observes on the whole <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FruitStore</code>, which makes it re-flow its body as long as any of store‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Published</code> property gets updated (aka. ‚Äúpublished‚Äù) - even though only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avocadoCount</code> is referenced in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code>.</p>

<p>Hmm, this is not good. We should probably embrace <em>Single-responsibility principle</em> here to make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> only observe on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">avocadoCount</code>, the data it cares about. In practice, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FruitStore</code> probably still has to exist to serve some aggregation functionality, or it could simply be it‚Äôs already a GOD hairball object that‚Äôs basically impossible to break down easily (yea you know what I‚Äôm talking about don‚Äôt you üåö). But fortunately enough:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I followed the calling by introducing a small and sweet  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoStore</code>:</p>

<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">AvocadoStore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">ObservableObject</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">@Published</span> <span class="kd">private(set)</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">avocadoCount</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">cancellable</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">AnyCancellable</span><span class="o">!</span>

    <span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">fruitStore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">FruitStore</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">cancellable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fruitStore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">avocadoCount</span>
            <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sink</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">avocadoCountInFruitStore</span> <span class="k">in</span>
            <span class="k">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">avocadoCount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">avocadoCountInFruitStore</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">struct</span> <span class="kt">AvocadoView</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">@ObservedObject</span> <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">avocadoStore</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">AvocadoStore</span>

    <span class="k">var</span> <span class="nv">body</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">some</span> <span class="kt">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nf">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Refreshing ü•ë view"</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kt">Text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">repeating</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">"ü•ë"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">count</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">avocadoStore</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">avocadoCount</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoStore</code> basically does is to bridge <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FruitStore</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> while preventing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> from being exposed to irrelevant noise (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peachCount</code> in our case). This all sounds right‚Ä¶but do we really need it?</p>

<p>I was deriving all my solutions so far based on an assumption: a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">View</code> is like a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UIView</code> - and calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> is like calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setNeedsLayout</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layoutSubviews</code>, which eventually leads to a view refresh. But the assumption is <em>wrong</em>, and it is exactly the major difference between SwiftUI and UIKit - the declarative and the imperative. In SwiftUI, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">View</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code> value type used to <em>describe</em> a view‚Äôs content and behavior - it‚Äôs not the view itself. And that‚Äôs it, the SwiftUI infrastructure will take care of the heavy lifting. In our original implementation, it‚Äôs true that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoView</code> ‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> gets called whenever <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fruitStore.peachCount</code> is updated - but it‚Äôs also true that it gets called with the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fruitStore.avocadoCount</code> value each time. The SwiftUI infra will be smart enough to process these <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">body</code> update messages and figure out what to do: ‚ÄúLast time it says there are X avocados, this time it‚Äôs still X. Nothing changes, just sit back and chill.‚Äù</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I‚Äôm not saying introducing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AvocadoStore</code> is completely worthless here. From the API design and dependency management perspective, it still makes a lot of sense - like how we use thin protocols to break down a fat class. It‚Äôs just the goal is not to correct a <em>fundamental fault</em> anymore. Bringing in a layer of indirection reduces coupling but could also fall part when it over complicates things - and that‚Äôs the tradeoff we need to make in production codebase at scale, case-by-case.</p>]]></content><author><name>Hao Luo</name><email>yvetterowe1116@gmail.com</email></author><category term="post" /><category term="ios" /><category term="swift" /><category term="tech" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[And body is not setNeedsLayout.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Â§öÂêÉÁÇπÔºåÊàëÁà±‰Ω†</title><link href="https://haoluo.io/posts/eat-and-love" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Â§öÂêÉÁÇπÔºåÊàëÁà±‰Ω†" /><published>2020-07-22T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-10-02T19:41:50-04:00</updated><id>https://haoluo.io/posts/eat-and-love</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://haoluo.io/posts/eat-and-love"><![CDATA[<p>ÔºàÊúÄËøëË∑üÁùÄÂ∞èÈ´òÂßêÂÅöÈ•≠ÈùûÂ∏∏ÊÉ≥ÂÆ∂‚Ä¶Ë¥¥‰∏ÄÁØáÂõõÂπ¥ÂâçÁöÑÊóßÊñáÔºâ</p>

<ul>
  <li>As long as you are well-prepared, seize a few opportunities, take appropriate action quickly, and do <strong>simple and logical</strong> things, your wealth will grow tremendously in your lifetime.</li>
  <li>The opportunities mentioned above are rare. They usually fall to those who are <strong>constantly searching and waiting</strong>, <strong>full of intellectual curiosity</strong>, and <strong>passionate about analyzing various different possibilities</strong>.</li>
  <li>Poor outcomes are acceptable (because some results are not within their control), but being unprepared and making hasty decisions are unforgivable, because these factors can be controlled.</li>
  <li>Good ideas are extremely rare‚Äîwhen the timing is in your favor, bet heavily.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="multidisciplinary-thinking">Multidisciplinary Thinking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze the ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù</li>
  <li>If all of a person‚Äôs information is limited to their field of work, then their work will not be done very well.</li>
  <li>You must have multiple mental models‚Äîbecause if you can only use one or two, the psychology of human nature shows that you will distort reality until it fits your mental models, or at least until you think it fits your models.</li>
  <li>Master all the major psychological models and use them as a checklist to examine the results of various complex systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="challenge-and-doubt-yourself">Challenge and Doubt Yourself</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Destroy our own most beloved ideas</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person for you to fool</li>
  <li>Face our personal knowledge deficiencies. You must figure out where your strengths are and must compete within your circle of competence.</li>
  <li>Keynes said: ‚ÄúIntroducing new ideas is not so difficult; the difficulty is clearing out the old ones.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cultivate-vision">Cultivate Vision</h3>
<ul>
  <li>From books or from people‚Äîpreferably both</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="independent-thinking">Independent Thinking</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I don‚Äôt like to be around people who always confidently answer questions they don‚Äôt actually understand.</li>
  <li>Excellent literary works require readers to think a little to understand them, so they have a deep impact on readers, and you will remember them more firmly. This is the tendency to commitment and consistency. If you use your brain to understand a truth, you will remember it better.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Calculate the appropriate margin of safety</li>
  <li>Avoid dealing with people who have moral character problems</li>
  <li>Insist on requiring appropriate compensation for predetermined risks</li>
  <li>Always remember the risks of inflation and interest rates</li>
  <li>Avoid making big mistakes; avoid continuous loss of capital</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stock-selection">Stock Selection</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The ideal situation is‚Äîwe have encountered many such situations‚Äîyou buy a great company that happens to have a <strong>great manager</strong>, because management matters.</li>
  <li>You can find a few companies whose managers can greatly increase profits just by raising prices‚Äîbut they haven‚Äôt done so yet. So they <strong>have untapped pricing power</strong>. People don‚Äôt need to think to know these are good stocks.</li>
  <li>We don‚Äôt jump over seven-foot bars. What we look for are one-foot bars with rich rewards on the other side. So the secret of our success is to <strong>do simple things, not solve difficult problems</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="choosing-work">Choosing Work</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Don‚Äôt sell anything you wouldn‚Äôt buy yourself.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt work for people you don‚Äôt respect and admire.</li>
  <li>Only work with people you like.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="psychology">Psychology</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Conditioned reflex</li>
  <li>Humans have a powerful tendency to ‚Äúmonkey see, monkey do,‚Äù which psychologists usually call ‚Äúsocial proof.‚Äù Social proof, imitative consumption caused simply by seeing others‚Äô consumption, can not only make consumers more receptive to our products, but also make consumers feel they are getting more rewards.</li>
  <li>Bias from incentive mechanisms. Professional people with this innate cognitive bias will think that what is good for themselves is good for clients and for the entire civilized society.</li>
  <li>Man-with-a-hammer tendency. This name comes from the proverb: ‚ÄúTo a man with a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.‚Äù</li>
  <li>Inversion (thinking about problems in reverse)</li>
  <li>Pay attention to the combined effect of multiple factors‚Äîthe lollapalooza effect</li>
  <li>If you want to persuade others, appeal to interests, not to reason.</li>
  <li>This tendency echoes a lyric: ‚ÄúIf the girl I love is not around, I love the girl who is around.‚Äù The human brain is limited and imperfect; it is easily satisfied with what is readily available. The brain cannot use what it cannot remember or recognize, because it is influenced by one or several psychological tendencies, such as the guy in the song above who is influenced by the girl around him. So the human brain overestimates the importance of readily available things, thus exhibiting the availability-misweighing tendency.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>Our training of pilots follows a strict six-element system. These six elements include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Teach him comprehensive enough knowledge so that he can master all the knowledge used in flight.</li>
  <li>Teach him all this knowledge not just to pass one or two exams, but to enable him to apply this knowledge skillfully, even to handle two or three intertwined complex dangerous situations simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Like any good algebraist, he must learn to sometimes use forward thinking and sometimes use reverse thinking, so he can understand when to focus mainly on what he wants and when to focus on situations he wants to avoid.</li>
  <li>He must receive training in various disciplines, striving to minimize the possibility of future losses due to incorrect operations; the most important operational steps must receive the strictest training to achieve the highest level of mastery.</li>
  <li>He must develop the habit of checking the ‚Äúchecklist.‚Äù</li>
  <li>After receiving initial training, he must routinely maintain mastery of this knowledge: regularly use flight simulators to prevent knowledge for dealing with rare but important problems from becoming rusty due to long-term disuse.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="rationality">Rationality</h3>
<p>The correct strategy to avoid doing stupid things because of past successes is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Carefully review each past success and identify the accidental factors in those successes, so as not to be misled by these factors and exaggerate the probability of success of new planned actions.</li>
  <li>Look at what dangerous factors the new action will encounter that did not appear in past successful experiences.</li>

It has been six months since then (crazy six months for this planet, I know), I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm back to my comfort zone now but there are definitely some takeaways that worth noting.</p>

<h4 id="async-communication">Async communication</h4>
<p>Async communication will just get more and more important as more employers embrace remote work. But even without that, I find this format of communication helpful in general - it forces people to structuralize their thoughts, exactly the feature of writing. When I first started, I got super frustrated with the high communication cost when I got stuck at my daily work. Why can‚Äôt I just direct message someone like ‚ÄúYo I don‚Äôt know how to do X, tell me plz‚Äù? Why do I have to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù my time drafting a post in a support group to get help? But as I get more comfortable doing this, it turns out to bring out some side effects that I didn‚Äôt expect before, in a good way.</p>

<p>I bet we all encounter some moments when people jump into your Slack channel for Q&amp;A. An ideal scenario would be like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alice: Yo I don‚Äôt know how to do X, please help. <br />
Bob: First you need to do A, then B, and finally C. Done. <br />
Alice: Thanks! <br />
Bob: You‚Äôre welcome!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But more often things turn out like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alice: Yo I don‚Äôt know how to do X, please help. <br />
Bob:  Did you do A by any chance? <br />
Alice: Yep A works. <br />
Bob: What‚Äôs the result of A? <br />
Alice: Here it is. <br />
Bob: This looks good. Did you do B then? <br />
Alice: Nope. <br />
Bob: Could you try that? <br />
Alice: Sure give me a seconds‚Ä¶ yeah B works too. <br />
Bob: Weird. Could you remind me why you need X? <br />
Alice: I was trying to do Y but got stuck getting X work. <br />
Bob: I see. I don‚Äôt think X is the best way to achieve Y, you should do Z. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alice is the one who needs help, but it takes a couple more prompts to collect information from her. I would be a bit frustrated if I was Bob. So how can Alice do better?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alice: My goal is Y but I got stuck at X. I did A and here‚Äôs the results. Please advise the next step, thanks! <br />
Bob:  I don‚Äôt think X is the best way to achieve Y, you should do Z. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or it could be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bob:  Yeah X is the right way for Y. From your results of A, seems you‚Äôre missing B. Could you try B?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two perspectives why this helps. First, a question with context, goal and the path to get stuck simply <em>help other people to help you</em>. This pre-processing of information eliminates the overhead for others to go over the problem from scratch and more importantly avoid deriving solutions based on <em>interpretations</em>/<em>assumptions</em> instead of <em>facts</em>. Second, I find writing the thought process down helps me fill in the gaps of my mind flow when reasoning about a problem (remember those proofs in highschool maths? xD). A classic mutter could be like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ok my goal is Y and I got stuck at X. I‚Äôve done A and B, and they work as expected. Hmm so why X doesn‚Äôt work? But wait‚Ä¶B isn‚Äôt necessarily related to X right? There‚Äôre some pieces missing here‚Ä¶Holy f, C actually connects B and X but I didn‚Äôt consider it at all!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah we think we really understand the problem until we write it down. To others who help us by consuming our information, it‚Äôs a pre-processing; To ourselves, it‚Äôs more like a post-processing that enhances the outputs.</p>

<h4 id="incremental-correctness">Incremental correctness</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perfectionism is often an excuse for procrastination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. I‚Äôve always been struggled with the frustration of not being 100% correct when learning something new. <em>Get overwhelmed ‚Üí get stuck ‚Üí lose momentum completely</em> is a classic script to achieve ‚ÄúFrom Beginning to Nothing‚Äù. Later, I figure out a more sustainable process for me is just being <em>OK</em> with not getting stuff completely correct at the very beginning. As we continue with the process of learning by doing, in a large chance the problem that bothers us will surface again - and by which time we usually either curate a global view and a deeper understanding of the whole problem space, which helps solve that particular problem; Or we simply find that particular problem just makes more sense in a concrete context. Then it‚Äôs the perfect time for a deep dive and correction. Keep the momentum and iteration.</p>]]></content><author><name>Hao Luo</name><email>yvetterowe1116@gmail.com</email></author><category term="post" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stumbling through the system.]]></summary></entry></feed>
