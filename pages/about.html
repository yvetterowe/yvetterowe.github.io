  <h1>About</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    Hey I'm Hao, currently an iOS engineer living in New York City. I enjoy building delightful stuff in a delightful way. And freestyle thinking. This is a playground where I turn shower thoughts into ramblings as I navigate through the chaos.

    In my spare time, I like <a href="http://vsco.co/yvetterowe" target="_blank" style="">street photography</a>, <a href="https://book.douban.com/people/yvetterowe_away/collect" target="_blank" style="">reading</a> and running. I'm also a museum / ballet / symphony / theatre / coffeeshop-goer (yay a little bit of everything).
